### This project was generated with Angular CLI version 9.0.2.
The application should include the following features:
1. User Registration
2. User Authentication (login/logout)
3. Visualize, add, edit and remove user projects
4. Visualize, add, edit and remove tasks associated with the projects

# Config Environments
* Base URL: 'http://localhost:3000'

# Multi-user Task Manager
This challenge involves the creation of a multi-user task manager web application

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
